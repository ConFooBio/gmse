********************************************************************************

**We are looking for a PhD student to work with us on conservation conflict at the [University of Stirling](http://stir.ac.uk), in partnership with [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/) and [Scottish Natural Heritage](https://www.nature.scot/).**

Project Description
-----------------------------------------------

The conservation of biodiversity is increasingly coming into conflict with stakeholders who rely on natural resources for their livelihoods and well-being [1]. Long-term conservation of populations therefore requires an understanding of conflict among stakeholders, and a strategy for managing conflict effectively. Conflict and cooperation between rational decision-makers can be studied formally using game theory. But conservation conflicts are highly complex, meaning that simple game-theoretic models are unlikely to understand and predict human decision-making [2].

Meanwhile, artificial intelligence has shown rapid progress in recent years, particularly in the context of decision-making in complex games [3]. The use of flexible artificial intelligence provides a promising avenue for investigating situations of human conflict and finding solutions to major global problems. For conservation conflicts, the initial development of artificial intelligence in stakeholder decision-making is available in the recently published GMSE R package (Generalised Management Strategy Evaluation) [4], which uses genetic algorithms to model human decision-making and  its effect populations [5]. Nevertheless, modelling complex negotiations, interactions among stakeholders, and the biological impact on populations remains a challenge, and requires new conceptual ideas and modelling techniques.

This project will develop and apply artificial intelligence to simulate the decision-making of stakeholders under situations of conservation conflict and the biological response of populations. Stakeholders and organisms will be modelled discretely using an agent-based modelling framework, allowing for potentially complex interactions within simulations [6].

<br>

The primary objective is to develop a flexible tool for the agent-based modelling of stakeholder decision-making and its  ecological consequences under conditions of conservation conflict, and to then apply this tool to one or more real-world case studies. Additional objectives might include the modelling and simulation of multi-species ecological systems under management, or the development of a graphical user interface for model users.

The student should have a background or very strong interest in programming (ideally in R, C, or C++), and an interest in applying social-ecological modelling to conservation biology. They will benefit from a team of experts in modelling and game-theory, and will interact more broadly with a network of researchers involved in case studies of real-world conservation conflicts.
