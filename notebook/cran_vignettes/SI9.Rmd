Overview of simulated annealing
================================================================================

The primary algorithm used in GMSE to model manager and user decision-making is the [genetic algorithm](SI1.pdf). As of version 1.0, GMSE also allows for the use of a simulated annealing algorithm [@Kirkpatrick1983; @Cerny1985; @Rutenbar1989]. Simulated annealing searches a space of potential solutions (in GMSE, decisions made by agents to maximise their own utility) in an iterative way. Unlike the [genetic algorithm](SI1.pdf), it is not a population focused approach.
