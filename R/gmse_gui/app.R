Density-based sampling, in which managers sample all resources within some subset of the landscape; the size of this subset is all of the resources within viewing distance of the cell of the manager. Managers sample a set number of landscape subsets (see below). Managers then extrapolate the density of resources in the subset to estimate the total number of resources on a landscape. \n\t 2. Mark-recapture estimate of the popuation, in which managers mark a fixed number of resources in the population without any spatial bias (if there are fewer than this fixed number of resources, managers sample all resources) a set number of times with replacement. The manager then recaptures a fixed number of resources, also without any spatial bias. A Chapman estimate is used in the manager model to estimate population size from these observation data. \n\t 3. Transect-based sampling (linear), in which a manager samples an entire row of the landscape and counts the resources on the row, then moves onto the next row of the landscape until the entire landscape has been covered. The number of cells in each row (i.e., the height) equals the manager's viewing distance, so fewer transects are needed if agents can see farther. Resources can potentially move on the landscape between each transect sampling, causing observation error if some resources are double counted or not counted at all due to movement. If resources are not allowed to move during sampling, then this type of observation should produce no error, and resource estimation will be exact. \n\t 4. Transect-based sampling (block), in which a manager samples a block of the landscape and counts the resources in the block, then moves on to the next (equally sized) block until the entire landscape has been covered. Blocks are square, with the length of each side equaling the manager's viewing distance, so fewer blocks are needed if agents can see farther. As with linear sampling, resources can potentially move on the landscape between each block sampling, causing observation error if some resources are double counted or not counted at all due to movement.",

Poisson selected movement in the x and y dimensions where distance in each direction is determined by a Poisson function and direction (e.g., left versus right) is randomly selected for each dimension. This type of movement tends to look a bit odd with low agent movement values because it results in very little diagonal movement. It also is not especially realistic, so should probably not be used without a good reason. \n\t 3.

(2) Upper right panel: Shows ownership of land by agents if 'Users own and act on their patch of land' is set to 'True' in the user model tab; land is divided proportional based on parameters set in gmse() and colours correspond with other subplots. This panel shows where actions are being performed by individual users, and where resources are affecting the landscape. (3) Middle left panel: Shows the actual population abundance (black solid line) and the population abundance estimated by the manager (blue solid line; where applicable, shading indicates 95 percent confidence intervals) over time. The dotted red line shows the resource carrying capacity (as applied to mortality) and the dotted blue line shows the target for resource abundance as set in the gmse() function; the orange line shows the total percent yield of the landscape (i.e., 100 percent means that resources have not decreased yield at all, 0 percent means that resources have completely destroyed all yield). (4) Middle right panel: Shows the raw landscape yield for each stakeholder (can be ignored if users do not own land) over time; colours correspond to land ownership shown in the upper right panel. (5) Lower left panel: The cost of stakeholders performing actions over time, as set by the manager. (6) Lower right panel: The total number of actions performed by all stakeholders over time."),

On the left axis, permissiveness is calculated as 100 minus the percent of the manager's budget put into increasing the cost of a particular action, so, e.g., if a manager puts all of their effort into increasing the cost of culling, then permissiveness of culling is 0; if they put none of their effort into increasing the cost of culling, then permissiveness of culling is 100. On the right axis, percentage of user action expended is the percent of a user's budget put into a particular action (note, these might not add up to 100 because users are not forced to use their entire budget). Coloured lines that are above black lines could potentially (cautiously) be interpreted as conflict between managers and users.")
