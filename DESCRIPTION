Description: Integrates game theory and ecological theory to construct 
    social-ecological models that simulate the management of populations and 
    stakeholder actions. These models build off of a previously developed 
    management strategy evaluation (MSE) framework to simulate all aspects of 
    management: population dynamics, manager observation of populations, manager
    decision making, and stakeholder responses to management decisions. The 
    newly developed generalised management strategy evaluation (GMSE) 
    framework uses genetic algorithms to mimic the decision-making process of 
    managers and stakeholders under conditions of change, uncertainty, and 
    conflict. All simulations can be run using the gmse() function.
