    <tr>
      <th>time_max</th>
      <td><p>This value sets the maximum number of time steps for a simulation. There are no constraints for length of time that a simulation can run. The default is 40 time steps.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>land_dim_1</th>
      <td><p>This value sets the number of cells on the x dimension of the landscape (i.e., the number of columns in the landscape array; this can also be thought of as the x-axis when the landscape image is plotted). There is no maximum, but the minimum dimension of a landscape is 2 cells. The default is 100 cells.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>land_dim_2</th>
      <td><p>This value sets the number of cells on the y dimension of the landscape (i.e., the number of columns in the landscape array; this can also be thought of as the y-axis when the landscape image is plotted). There is no maximum, but the minimum dimension of a landscape is 2 cells. The default is 100 cells.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>res_movement</th>
      <td><p>This value determines how far resources move during a time step. Exact movement is probabilistic and partly affected by `res_move_type` settings. Under default settings, during each time step, resources move from zero to res_movement cells away from their starting cell in any direction. Hence res_movement is the maximum distance away from a resources starting cell that it can move in a time step; other types of resource movement, however, interpret res_movement differently to get the raw distance moved (see res_move_type). The default value is 20.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>remove_pr</th>
      <td><p>This value is the density-independent and user-independent probability of a resource being removed (e.g., dying) during a time step in the resource model. Under default settings, this value is set to zero, with resource removal being determined entirely by carrying capacity on resource survival, and by user actions.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>lambda</th>
      <td><p>This value is the baseline population growth rate of resources. Each resource in the simulation produces Poisson(lambda) offspring in one time step within the resource model. The value of lambda might be increased or decreased by user actions, and juvenile survival can potentially be decreased by a carrying capacity placed on birth. The default value is 0.3, meaning that the average resource produces one offspring every three time steps.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>agent_view</th>
      <td><p>This value determines how far agents (managers and stakeholders) can see on the landscape. At the moment, this affects only the sampling ability of managers in the observation model for density-based and transect-based estimates of resource abundance. In these types of estimates, when managers have a higher agent_view, they are capable of observing a larger area of landscape and therefore of getting a larger (in the case of density-based estimation) or more efficient (in the case of transect-based estimation) sample of resources from which to estimate total resource abundance. The default value of agent_view is 10, so agents can see 10 cells away from their current cell in any direction.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>agent_move</th>
      <td><p>This value determines how far agents can move. At the moment, this does not affect much in the simulation because agent movement does not affect agent actions (interactions with resources can be limited to stakeholder's owned land, but do not currently depend on where an agent is on the landscape -- effectively assuming that agents are mobile enough to do what they want to do to resources). The one exception is for density-based estimation, which can be biased by low values of agent_move by causing the manager to sample the same (or nearby) landscape cells to estimate total resource abundance; if resources are spatially autocorrelated, then managers might over or under-estimate total abundance. Therefore, as a default, this value is set to 50 so that managers can move to any cell on a (torus) landscape in a time step, removing any bias for density sampling.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>res_birth_K</th>
      <td><p>This value is the carrying capacity on new resources added per time step (e.g., birth). If more offspring are born in a time step than res_birth_K, then offspring are randomly removed from the population until offspring born equals res_birth_K. By default, carrying capacity is effectively applied to death instead of birth, so the default value of res_birth_K is set to 100000 (and hence not enacted because the number of births is never this high).</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>res_death_K</th>
      <td><p>This value is the carrying capacity on resources in the population. Carrying capacity is realised by an increase in mortality probability as resource abundance approaches res_death_K. In each time step, realised mortality probability equals the number of resources over carrying capacity divided by the number of resources (i.e., [resource count - carrying capacity] / resource count). Hence, as the resource abundance increases above carrying capcity, mortality probability also increases in proportion, generating some stochasticity in resource survival. Note that carrying capacity is independent of user actions; if a user culls a resource this culling is applied after mortality probability due to carrying capacity has already been calculated. The default value for res_death_K is 2000.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>edge_effect</th>
      <td><p>This determines what happens at the edge of the landscape. Currently there is only one option (value 1), which causes the landscape to wrap around as a torus (effectively removing the edge); resources that leave off of one side of the landscape will reappear on the other side of the landscape.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>res_move_type</th>
      <td><p>This determines the type of movement that resources do. There are four different movement options: (0) No movement -- resources are sessile, (1) Uniform movement in any direction up to `res_movement` cells away during a time step. Movement direction is random and the cell distance moved is randomly selected from zero to `res_movement`. (2) Poisson selected movement in the x and y dimensions where distance in each direction is determined by Poisson(res_movement) and direction (e.g., left versus right) is randomly selected for each dimension. This type of movement tends to look a bit odd with low `res_movement` values because it results in very little diagonal movement. It also is not especially biologically realistic, so should probably not be used without a good reason. (3) Uniform movement in any direction up to `res_movement` cells away during a a time step `res_movement` times. In other words, the `res_movement` variable of each resource is acting to determine the times that a resource moves in a time step and the maximum distance it travels each time it moves. This type of movement has been simulated in ecological models, particularly plant-pollinator systems. The default movement type is (1).</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>res_birth_type</th>
      <td><p>The type of resource addition (birth) that occurs. Currently, the only value allowed is 2, which causes all resources to produce Poisson(lambda) offspring each time step, where `lambda` is the population growth rate also set as an argument in gmse simulations.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>res_death_type</th>
      <td><p>The type of resource removal (death) that occurs. A value of (1) causes death to be entirely density-independent and with a probability of `removal_pr` for each resource (which may be further affected by agent actions or interactions with landscape cells). A value of (2) causes death to be entirely density-dependent (though potentially independently affected by agents and landscape), with mortality probability calculated based on the carrying capacity `res_death_K` set in as an argument in gmse simulations. A value of (3) allows for both density-dependent (affected by `res_death_K`) and density-independent (affected by `removal_pr`) effects on resource removal. The default `res_death_type` is (2); values of (1) must be used carefully because it can result in exponential growth that leads to massive population sizes that slow down simulations.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>observe_type</th>
      <td><p>The type of observation sampling of resources being done by managers in the observation model. There are currently four options for sampling. (0) Density-based sampling, in which managers sample all resources within some subset of the landscape; the size of this subset is all of the resources within a distance of `agent_view` from the cell of the manager. Managers sample `times_observe` subsets, where `times_observe` is a parameter value set in the gmse simulation. Managers then extrapolate the density of resources in the subset to estimate the total number of resources on a landscape. (1) Mark-recapture estimate of the popluation, in which managers randomly sample `fixed_mark` resources (without replacement) in the population without any spatial bias (if there are fewer than `fixed_mark` resources, managers sample all resources). The manager then randomly samples `fixed_recapt` resources (without replacement), again without any spatial bias. A Chapman estimate is then used in the manager model to estimate population size from these mark-recapture data. (2) Transect-based sampling (linear), in which a manager samples an entire row of the landscape and counts the resources on the row, then moves onto the next row of the landscape until the entire landscape has been covered. The number of cells in each row (i.e., the height) equals `agent_view`, so fewer transects are needed if agents can see farther. If `res_move_obs == TRUE`, then resources can move on the landscape between each transect sampling, potentially causing observation error if some resources are double counted or not counted at all due to movement. If `res_move_obs == FALSE`, then this type of observation should produce no error, and resource estimation will be exact. (3) Transect-based sampling (block), in which a manager samples a block of the landscape and counts the resources in the block, then moves on to the next (equally sized) block until the entire landscape has been covered. Blocks are square, with the length of each side equaling `agent_view`, so fewer blocks are needed if agents can see farther. If `res_move_obs == TRUE`, then resources can move on the landscape between each block sampling, potentially causing observation error if some resources are double counted or not counted at all due to movement. If `res_move_obs == FALSE`, then this type of observation should produce no error, and resource estimation will be exact. The default observation type is 0 for density-based sampling.</p></td>

      <td><p>This determines the type of movement that agents do. The four different movement types of agents are identical to those of resources: : (0) No movement -- agents are sessile, (1) Uniform movement in any direction up to `agent_move` cells away during a time step. Movement direction is random and the cell distance moved is randomly selected from zero to `agent_move`. (2) Poisson selected movement in the x and y dimensions where distance in each direction is determined by Poisson(agent_move) and direction (e.g., left versus right) is randomly selected for each dimension. This type of movement tends to look a bit odd with low `agent_move` values because it results in very little diagonal movement. It also is not especially realistic, so should probably not be used without a good reason. (3) Uniform movement in any direction up to `agent_move` cells away during a a time step `agent_move` times. In other words, the `agent_move` variable of each agent is acting to determine the times that an agent moves in a time step and the maximum distance it travels each time it moves. This type of movement has been simulated in ecological models, particularly plant-pollinator systems. The default movement type is (1).</p></td>

The plotted function plots the dynamics of GMSE resource, observation, managemer, and user models in six separate sub-panels. (1) Upper left panel: Shows the locations of resources on the landscape (black dots); landscape terrain is also shown in brown, but at the moment, this is only cosmetic and does not reflect anything occurring in the model. (2) Upper right panel: Shows ownership of land by agents; land is divided proportional based on parameters set in gmse() and colours correspond with other subplots. If agent utilities and actions are restricted to land (`land_ownership` in the gmse() function), then this gives some idea of where actions are being performed and where resources are affecting the landscape. (3) Middle left panel: Shows the actual population abundance (black solid line) and the population abundance estimated by the manager (blue solid line) over time. The dotted red line shows the resource carrying capacity (death-based) and the dotted blue line shows the target for resource abundance as set in the gmse() function; the orange line shows the total percent yield of the landscape (i.e., 100 percent means that resources have not decreased yield at all, 0 percent means that resources have completely destroyed all yield). (4) Middle right panel: Shows the raw landscape yield for each stakeholder (can be ignored if `land_ownership` is FALSE) over time; colours correspond to land ownership shown in the upper right panel.

    <p>A large list is returned that includes detailed simulation histories for the resource, observation, management, and user models. This list includes eight elements, most of which are themselves complex lists of arrays: (1) A list of length `time_max` in which each element is an array of resources as they exist at the end of each time step. Resource arrays include all resources and their attributes (e.g., locations, growth rates, offspring, how they are affected by stakeholders, etc.). (2) A list of length `time_max` in which each element is an array of resource observations from the observation model. Observation arrays are similar to resource arrays, except that they can have a smaller number of rows if not all resources are observed, and they have additional columns that show the history of each resource being observed over the course of `times_observe` observations in the observation model. (3) A 2D array showing parameter values at each time step (unique rows); most of these values are static but some (e.g., resource number) change over time steps. (4) A list of length `time_max` in which each element is an array of the landscape that identifies proportion of crop production per cell. This allows for looking at where crop production is increased or decreased over time steps as a consequence of resource and stakeholder actions. (5) The total time the simulation took to run (not counting plotting time). (6) A 2D array of agents and their traits. (7) A list of length `time_max` in which each element is a 3D array of the costs of performing each action for managers and stakeholders (each agent gets its own array layer with an identical number of rows and columns); the change in costs of particular actions can therefore be be examined over time. (8) A list of length `time_max` in which each element is a 3D array of the actions performed by managers and stakeholders (each agent gets its own array layer with an identical number of rows and columns); the change in actions of agents can therefore be examined over time. Because the above lists cannot possibly be interpreted by eye all at once in the simulation output, it is highly recommended that the contents of a simulation be stored and interprted individually if need be; alternativley, simulations can more easily be interpreted through plots when `plotting = TRUE`.</p>
